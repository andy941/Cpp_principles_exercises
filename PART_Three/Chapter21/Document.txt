Are you sure you need this? Because that's not possible. An unordered_map is a hash container, that is, the keys are hashed. 
Inside of the container, they don't have the same representation as on the outside. Even the name implies that you can't sort 
it. It's one of the criteria to choose a hash container: You do not need a specific order.
